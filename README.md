Here is a variable analysis project that my classmates and I worked on during my time at university. It is based on League of Legends video game data collected over a total of two years. 
The data analysis was carried out using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, and the pdf file is the formalization of the study. Thank you for taking a look!
